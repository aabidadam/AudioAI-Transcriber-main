## Project Overview
### Introduction

This project demonstrates how to record audio, save it, and transcribe it using OpenAI's Whisper model. It also includes generating responses using the OpenAI GPT-4 API. The project utilizes `ipywebrtc` for web-based audio recording and `pyaudio` for local audio recording.


### Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenAI
- ipywebrtc
- pyaudio
- torchaudio
- pydub
- whisper


### Features
- Web-Based Audio Recording: Utilizes ipywebrtc for capturing audio directly from the browser.
- Local Audio Recording: Implements pyaudio for recording audio locally on the device.
- Transcription with Whisper: Uses Whisper for transcribing audio files.
- Integration with OpenAI: Demonstrates integration possibilities with OpenAI's GPT-4 API for response generation.


### Functionality
-  Recording Control: Includes buttons for starting and stopping audio recording sessions.
- File Management: Saves recorded audio files locally.
- Transcription: Converts audio recordings into text using Whisper's capabilities.

### Future Development
- Enhance user interface for better recording control.
- Expand audio processing features.
- Support additional audio formats and languages for transcription.

## Running the Project

### 1.Web-Based Audio Recording:

- Launch the Jupyter notebook or Python script (web_recording.ipynb or web_recording.py).
- Execute the provided code to start and stop audio recording using ipywebrtc.

#### 2.Local Audio Recording:

- Run the Python script (local_recording.py) for local audio recording.
- Adjust settings like audio format, sample rate, and output file location as needed.

#### 3.Transcription:

- Ensure Whisper is installed and configured (pip install whisper).
- Use the provided functions (transcribe_audio) to transcribe recorded audio files.

## Example Usage

### 1.Start Recording:
```
from my_project import start_recording, stop_and_save_recording
recorder = start_recording()
```
### 2.Stop and Save Recording:
```
stop_and_save_recording(recorder)
```
### 3.Transcribe Audio:
```
transcription = transcribe_audio("path_to_recorded_audio.wav")
print("Transcription:", transcription)
```
